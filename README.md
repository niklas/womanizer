== We need more women in tech ==

Here is a technical approach:


    require 'womanizer'
    Womanizer.ok!

    ok moREWoman moREWoMaN moREWoMan moREWomAN morEwoman morEwomAn moRewOman moREwoMaN moREwOMan moREwOMan moREwOMAN morEwoman moReWoMAN moREwOMAN moREWomAn moREwOMan moREwoMan morEwomaN morEwomAn morewOmAn

Run it and it outputs `Hello world`.

You can get "morewoman" by piping to the binary

    $ womanizer encode < mylib.rb

* Why that punning name and premise? Are you a sexist?

I try my best not to be. The premise stems from the obvious frustration of the community to increase the number of female(\*) humans in tech and other industries. I personally feel kind of powerless to change this in any significant amount by myself -- so I escape into humor to cope with that. By my definition, a "womanizer" is a person who tries to achieve his goals always in the same way with only small variations -- and looks rather stupid doing that. In that way this gem is similar.

Additionally all other names that came to my mind were already taken.
