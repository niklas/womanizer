== We need more women in tech ==

Here is a technical approach:


    require 'womanizer'
    Womanizer.ok!

    moREWoman moREWoMaN moREWoMan moREWomAN morEwoman morEwomAn moRewOman moREwoMaN moREwOMan moREwOMan moREwOMAN morEwoman moReWoMAN moREwOMAN moREWomAn moREwOMan moREwoMan morEwomaN morEwomAn morewOmAn

Run it and it outputs `Hello world`.

You can get "morewoman" by piping to the binary

    $ lib/womanizer.rb encode < mylib.rb
